<p>Black Rhino foundation is a small effort to provide technical help to all those working in sectors like animal welfare, wildlife conservation, climate protection, orphanages, old age homes etc. In a nutshell we help them who help others. We at Black Rhino Foundation provide technological help to such people/organizations.</p>
<h3 id="intention-behind-the-name-black-rhino">Intention behind the name Black Rhino</h3>
<p>We at Black Rhino love animals. We believe that by using the name <strong><em>Black Rhino</em></strong> we want whoever visits our page, to know that Black Rhino is one of the many critically endangered. If the visitor ask us about the name or read this section then our purpose is served. We want to spread awareness about animal extinction.</p>
<h3 id="what-we-do-">What we do ?</h3>
<p>We offer our software engineering skills to people/organizations. We help develop software applications which includes but not limited to website, desktop app and mobile app. We don&#39;t know everything but we try learn technologies or get someone like us to work on that. The person working on such projects are motivated by cause and so there is no financial gains. We prefer students who are willing to contribute over professionals so that they can learn something and proudly show projects in their CVs.</p>
<h3 id="how-we-do-what-we-do-">How we do what we do ?</h3>
<p>When someone asks for help, we analyze how we can help. We decide what technology to use and gather people (friends, colleagues) to work on that depending theirs and our availability. Again there is no financial gain in this activity. We do this entirely free and in our extra time. All of us already have day job. So there is a possibility that we may not have enough bandwidth.</p>
